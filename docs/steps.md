### Development

#### 1.1. Core File System Development

**1.1.1. Distributed File System (DFS) Implementation**

-   **File and Hyperlink Storage**:
    -   **Data Structure Design**:
        -   Design and implement data structures for storing files and hyperlinks. Consider using a combination of hash tables for quick access and trees or graphs to represent relationships between files and hyperlinks.
        -   Ensure the data structures support efficient storage and retrieval, with mechanisms to handle large files and a potentially massive number of hyperlinks.
    -   **Metadata Management**:
        -   Develop a robust metadata management system to track file attributes (e.g., size, type, ownership, access rights) and hyperlink properties (e.g., source, destination, tags).
        -   Implement a distributed metadata service that synchronizes across nodes, ensuring consistency and availability.
    -   **Data Replication & Redundancy**:
        -   Implement replication strategies to ensure data is duplicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance.
        -   Develop algorithms to manage data consistency, including conflict resolution strategies for scenarios where multiple nodes might attempt to modify the same file simultaneously.
    -   **Distributed Storage**:
        -   Create storage modules that distribute data across nodes based on factors like load balancing, data locality, and fault tolerance.
        -   Implement mechanisms to detect and recover from node failures, ensuring data is accessible even in adverse conditions.
